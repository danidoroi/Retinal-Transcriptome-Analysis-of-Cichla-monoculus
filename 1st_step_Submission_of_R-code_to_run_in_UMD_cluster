### to run an R-script  in the command line in deepthought2, you can type "run_Rscript.sh" this tells the command line to recognizes
#### Rcode as input. This is the necessary step to load and execute your code. Otherwise you won't do shit
### we can then run our .sh file with the command Rscript in it.
### the ".sh" file should have something like this

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --ntasks=20
#SBATCH -N 1
#SBATCH -t 4000:00
#SBATCH --mem=127000

###  this is the path to my directory where I have the files the R-code in this case "daniel_EC.R"
cd /lustre/descoba2/Cichla/Scripts

### this is to run R-code but through Rscript environments.
### notice that my lab-group user has the different programs and folders to run R-code. In this case "daniel_EC.R" is the code.
/lustre/cichlid-labs/sw/R-3.1.0/bin/Rscript --daniel_EC.R
