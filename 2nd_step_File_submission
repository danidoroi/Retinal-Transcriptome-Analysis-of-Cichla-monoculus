### We have 7 transcriptomes 
## CM1, CM4, CM16, CM17, CM27, CM28, CM29
## CM1, CM4, CM16 & CM17 are samples from clear waters of Lake Gatun
## CM27, CM28, CM29 are samples from murky waters of Lake Gatun


### Now... I have already analyzed the fq files (files with the raw reads), we have checked que quality of the reads with Fastqc and we
### have already trimmed the reads with trimommatic in order to have higher quality. We have forward and reverse (paired-ends reads)
### files from each of the seven samples.

### We then want to align these reads files to a reference genome but first we have to specify the "targets" file
### which is the file that contains all the necessary information about the reads files like names, etc...
### the following matrix is an example of a target file

### first you load the target file from a .txt document

targetsPE.txt <- read.table("/lustre/descoba2/Cichla/R_project/target_file.txt", header=F)

### then you specify targetspath which is the set up for targets file specified by bioconductor

targetspath <- system.file("extdata", "targetsPE.txt", package="systemPipeR")

### reads the table and creates a data.frame from that specifying the dimensions of the table/

read.delim(targetspath, comment.char = "#")[1:7,1:4]

### is basically something like this, here in the first two columns you have the names of the forward and reverse reads files
### then you have the 3 and 4 column to specify the the name of the sample and the treatment in this case named "factor"
### you need the 3 and 4 column so you can do pairwise comparissons later

File_Name1	File_Name2	Sample_Name	Factor

###
#### you can then later set it up for it to make sample comparissons

readLines(targetspath)[1:4]


### import comparisson and store them in a list

readComp(file=targetspath, format="vector", delim="-")
